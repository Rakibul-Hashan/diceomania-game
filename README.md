# 🎲 Diceomania Game 🎲

Welcome to **Diceomania**, an exciting two-player dice game where the thrill of strategy meets luck! The objective is simple: Roll the dice, accumulate points, and be the first to reach 100. But watch out! If you roll a 1, you lose your current score!

## 🚀 Gameplay Features

- **2 Players**: The game is designed for two players, with the active player's section highlighted for clarity.
- **Roll the Dice**: Each player takes turns rolling the dice. If the dice shows any number between 2 and 6, it’s added to the player’s current score.
- **Hold the Score**: Players can choose to "Hold" their current score at any time, adding it to their main score. If the player rolls a 1 before holding, their current score is reset to 0.
- **Winning Criteria**: The first player to reach 100 or more points wins!
- **Dynamic Visuals**: When a player wins, the game rewards the victor with a celebration of confetti (or comfy) animations that pop up from both sides of the screen, adding a fun and visually appealing touch.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Roll**: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll a dice and accumulate points in your current score.
2. **Hold**: If you're satisfied with your points and want to keep them, click the "Hold" button. Your current score will be added to your total score.
3. **Switch Turns**: If you roll a 1, your current score is lost, and it's the other player's turn.
4. **Win the Game**: The first player to reach 100 or more points wins and is greeted with a celebratory animation.
